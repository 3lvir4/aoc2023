# Advent of Code 2023

Trying with Elixir...

**Log book:**
<br>

Day 1: I forgot `&Stream.replace/4` existed.

Day 2:
- Misread the first part so I fumbled it at the beggining but turned out ok
- Part 2 was easier than part 1. Maybe biased because of the fumbling I mentioned.

Day 3:
- Learnt the existence of `&Regex.scan/3`
- Wasn't enough pragmatic at first trying to detect a symbol by using regex lol
- `&Regex.scan/3` is bonkers

Day 4: Almost though I would need to use some advanced struct on the 2nd part but it turned out
as easy as the 1st part.

Day 5:
- Tried firstly with a brute force approach which was just the worst performance solution ever
(didn't expected it to be the opposite, it still was funny tho)
- So for the first part, I used my first approach and built an alternative  solution which
was way better performance wise
- The second part was easier but took time to decide if i was going for full interval manipulations
or just turning on my computer for a whole weekday and wait
- My favorite day yet.
