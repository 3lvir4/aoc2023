# Advent of Code 2023

Trying with Elixir...

**Log book:**
<br>

Day 1: I forgot `&Stream.replace/4` existed.

Day 2:
- Misread the first part so I fumbled it at the beggining but turned out ok
- Part 2 was easier than part 1. Maybe biased because of the fumbling I mentioned.

Day 3:
- Learnt the existence of Regex.scan
- Wasn't enough pragmatic at first trying to detect a symbol by using regex lol
- Regex.scan is bonkers
