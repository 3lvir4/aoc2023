# Advent of Code 2023

Trying with Elixir...

**Log book:**
<br>

Day 1: I forgot `&Stream.replace/4` existed.

Day 2:
- Misread the first part so I fumbled it at the beggining but turned out ok.
- Part 2 was easier than part 1. Maybe biased because of the fumbling I mentioned.

Day 3:
- Learnt the existence of `&Regex.scan/3`.
- Wasn't enough pragmatic at first trying to detect a symbol by using regex lol.
- `&Regex.scan/3` is bonkers.

Day 4: Almost though I would need to use some advanced struct on the 2nd part but it turned out
as easy as the 1st part.

Day 5:
- Tried firstly with a brute force approach which was just the worst performance solution ever
(didn't expected it to be the opposite, it still was funny tho).
- So for the first part, I used my first approach and built an alternative  solution which
was way better performance wise.
- The second part was easier but took time to decide if i was going for full interval manipulations
or just turning on my computer for a whole weekday and wait.
- My favorite day yet.

Day 6: Too easy.

Day 7:
- Could have been fun If I didn't brute forced it.
- Maybe will try to redo both parts in a more efficient way even tho it didn't took more than 1.5s on average
to give the answer.

Day 8: Heavy sweat on part 2 but god bless debug print. Huge luck on this one lol.

Day 9: Too easy + lazy.

Day 10:
- Finished first part although I am not sure if it was the best way to do it but anyway.
- Didn't finished second part yet.
- First time of using a special module inside a day module. Funnily enough, it was reusable the next day.

Day 11:
- Was easy, learnt at last how to manage modules calls on the fly, because using modules which are outside
of the current file doesn't get compiled along the current executed script.
- Might not be the best performance wise but was too tired because of day 10. Didn't want to optimize. Was enough.

Day 10 bis:
- At last, completed second part, with a cool head. Wasn't that bad, I am pretty sure I just made the dumb mistake
of filtering out the points which weren't poiting to a dot char. Might be why It was wrong in the first place.
